### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Computer Science Masters Student at Boston University with a BA in Chemistry and Computer Science, passionate about trying out new developer technologies. I am an experienced manager, with a background in research and consultancy. 

At Spark!, I lead multiple teams as an Agile Project Manager to extract insights from unstructured data, liaising with clients to understand their needs. In my involvement with BostonHacks, I led a cross-functional team of 10 engineers developing an open source portal for Organizers, Hackers and Sponsors to stay involved with BostonHacks.

Iâ€™m also interested in helping build the future of diagnostics - miniaturizing the machinery, making it reliable and cost-effective. In my position as a Flutter Developer for OXOS Medical, Iâ€™m developing a Flutter app for the Micro C device, allowing doctors on the field to digitally design their X-ray strategies, share X-ray data with the patients, and use anonymized data to intelligently design X-ray schemes.
